# **About Me**

Hello, My name is {{ site.author.name }}! :wave:
========================================

I'm a professional Game Developer and Web Developer based in Wisconsin.

Since 2004 I've been living and breathing software development, progressively building and expanding my skillset. Creating everything from video games to distributed networking solutions and AR/VR marketing applications. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects in the last 17 years, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. 

## Personal Projects and Facts

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an experimental open source MMO using Panda3D.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been writing software since I was around 8 years old. I was drawn to programming through my interest in video games.
